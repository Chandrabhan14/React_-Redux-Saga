# React_-Redux-Saga
This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding and implementing Redux Saga with React applications.<br>
Redux Saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e., asynchronous actions like data fetching and impure operations like accessing browser storage) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.
